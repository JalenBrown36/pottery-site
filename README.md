# Pottery Website
Inspired by https://thepotterycove.com/ 

Designed by **Kayla Moore**

Developed by **Jalen Brown**

## Goals
This project is inspired by local online shops 🏪 with a primary focus on arts and crafts, aka ✨Pottery✨. In an effort to learn and build a web application 🌐, I collaborated with an artist named Kayla. We are currently working together to create an improved version of the "The Pottery Cove" website. Don't worry we will not profiting from this 👌, but only showcasing our work on this platform 😁.
